# MyNode

The humble basics of a bitcoin node that can handshake with another node, written as a coding exercise.

To run the test suite, simply

```
go test ./...
```

To check that the handshake with another node succeeds, run a local bitcoin node, for example:

```shell
go run github.com/btcsuite/btcd@latest
```
